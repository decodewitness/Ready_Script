# ready_script

This script will read your documents out loud.
Change the input file which is stored in the "filename" variable, to whatever document you want to have the program read out loud.

----------

E.g.:

    filename = "my_document.txt"

(to read 'my_document.txt' from the same directory)



If you want for instance to read a document from your Downloads folder:

    filename = "C:\Users\<your username>\Downloads\my_document.txt"
