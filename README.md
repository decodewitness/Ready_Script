# ready_script

This script will read your documents out loud.
Change the "input_file" to whatever document you want to have read.

E.g.:

    input_file = "my_document.txt"

(to read 'my_document.txt' from the same directory)



If you want for instance to read a document from your Downloads folder:

    input_file = "C:\Users\<your username>\Downloads\my_document.txt"
