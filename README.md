# ready_script

This script will read your documents out loud.
Change the input file which is stored in the "filename" variable, to whatever document you want to have the program read out loud.

----------

E.g.:

    filename = "my_document.txt"

(to read 'my_document.txt' from the same directory)



If you want for instance to read the 'my_document.txt' file and it's in your Windows Downloads folder you can use the full path like (don't forget to change <your username> to the name of your Windows user username, e.g. "Administrator"):

    filename = "C:\Users\<your username>\Downloads\my_document.txt"
